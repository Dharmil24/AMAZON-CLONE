# AMAZON-CLONE
The project aims to replicate the frontend interface of Amazon, focusing on building a responsive and visually accurate clone. It was developed to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while learning about layout structures, navigation bars, product listings, and user experience design.
